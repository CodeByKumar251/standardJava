	 * When to use?
	 * if we know that a class(A) will be used by only one another class(B) then instead of created a new file
	 * (A.java) for it , we can create nested class inside B class itself.
	 * and 
	 * also help us to group logically related classes in one file.
	 * 
	 * Scope:-scope of nested class is same as scope of outer class
